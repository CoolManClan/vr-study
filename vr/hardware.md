# Hardware Used For Virtual Reality

## Vision

### Display
A display capable of at least:
- 2 1980p screens, lower may cause the screen-door effect
- 60 hz, any lower increases risk for nausea

### Optics

#### Lenses
The lenses of the headset are responsible for mapping the up-close display to a
wide field of view.

## Controller

## Sound

## Tracking

### User Movement
The headset needs to know where you are in space, it does this using the 
following components:
- Gyroscope : to track rotation
- Accelerometer : to track your position
- Compass : to track the direction you are facing

### Inside-Out Tracking
The headset may need to know what your surroundings look like. It does this 
using a camera of some sort:
- Infra-Red
- Generic Camera : quality may increase if capturing in grayscale rather than
  full color

The rest of the work is done in software.

### Outside-In Tracking
The headset may use external trackers mounted in the environment to track your
position, these normally are IR cameras that capture IR emitted from your 
headset.
